# Why I started this project

Due to some thought on December 11th 2020 (nighttime) about the number of atoms in the human body, compared to the number of atoms required to make the smallest known byte of data (about 14 atoms * 8 = ~112 atoms) and due to having so many Gigabytes of Tiny Tower pictures (1 Gigabyte = ~112000000000 atoms) and Jewels pictures, I looked for a solution to avoid unnecessarily hitting the limits of Moores law, as there are going to be people that do the same thing I do, and I need a way to reduce the memory usage of what I have.

This project was born out of this thought as a solution. It is estimated to be able to save at least 500 Gigabytes (at least ~5.6×10¹³ (or ~56000000000000) atoms) of space from the amount of screenshots I have taken (As of December 12th 2020) it is also a unique idea in other ways, as a screenshot virtual machine has not been created before.
